# Optimo MoveIt Config

An automatically generated package with all the configuration and launch files for using the Optimo with the MoveIt Motion Planning Framework, with some modifications.



.. note:: This package's automatically generated demos are not fully functional, due to no position controller being configured with the the Optimo. Our current intention is to have move_group_servo.launch.py and and move_group.launch.py used in conjunction with either Gazebo or the actual hardware, such that SEA torque control can be utilized.
